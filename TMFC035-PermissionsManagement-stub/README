This folder contains the TMFC035 component, implemented as a stub. It exposes the TMF669 PartyRole API core function for the
TMFC028 Party component, which depends on this API.

This stub is used when running the TMFC028 CTK BDD tests. It allows the TMFC028 Party component to interact with the PartyRole API
and verify that a partyRole instance referenced in "party.relatedParty[0]" actually exists in the TMFC035 PartyRole service.
