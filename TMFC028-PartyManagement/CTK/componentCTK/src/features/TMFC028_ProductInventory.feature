Feature: Dependent API interaction testing for tmfc028 - Party

  Scenario Outline: Test dependent API interactions with different payloads
    Given the CTK target component "<componentUnderTest>" with exposed API ID "<exposedApiId>" and dependent API ID "<dependentApiId>" has been installed successfully
    And the supporting stub "<dependentComponent>" for API "<dependentAPI>" has been installed successfully
    Given the target component API "<exposedAPI>" is initialized with the payload defined in file "<basePayload>"
    Given the dependent API stub "<dependentAPI>" is initialized with the payload defined in file "<basePayload2>"
    When a "<resourceType>" with "<resourceFieldPath>" on payload defined in file "<targetPayload>" is created in API "<exposedAPI>" expecting "<expectedResponse>"
    Then expected response for operation "<operationID>" should be "<expectedResponse>"

  Examples:
    | componentUnderTest | dependentComponent   | resourceType  | exposedApiId  | exposedAPI   | dependentApiId | dependentAPI  | basePayload              | basePayload2                  | targetPayload             | resourceFieldPath          | operationID        | expectedResponse |
